      While on watch, Kat hears some sounds which don't fit in with the usual sounds of creaking timbers, rigging and luffing sails. She follows her ears to investigate. Inside the hold, she finds #{@sailor} and #{@sailor2}, unclothed and entwined with each other, bare skin glistening in the starlight.
